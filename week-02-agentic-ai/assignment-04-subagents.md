# Assignment 4 — Building Your AI Team

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will build and configure a set of specialized AI subagents inside your project. You will learn how different models and tool permissions define agent behavior, and you will trigger two real agent delegations to analyze security and cost aspects of your Terraform infrastructure.

---

# Task 1 — Create the Agents Folder and Add Files

## Goal

Create the `.claude/agents/` directory and add all required agent files.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — VS Code sidebar showing `.claude/agents/` with all 3 files

# Task 2 — Compare the Agent Configurations

## Goal

Analyze the configuration differences between the three agents and demonstrate understanding of model and tool selection.

### Written Answers

#### 1. Why does the cost optimizer use Haiku instead of Sonnet?

The cost optimizer employs Haiku since it is an algorithm that needs to analyze the infrastructure and detect cost reductions. The security analyzer on the other hand performs tasks which need reasoning capabilities that can only be provided by algorithms like LISP and Prolog.

---

#### 2. Why does the security auditor NOT have Write in its tools list?

The security auditor is intended for scanning and detection of security vulnerabilities, not for modification of the environment. This tool needs read-only access to be able to examine Terraform files without making any changes. This will follow the principle of least privilege, which states that the agent needs only those permissions which are required for performing the job.

---

#### 3. Why does the tf-writer use `inherit` instead of a specific model?

Inheritance is employed in tf-writer to allow it to leverage the model that is set up for the particular Claude Code session and not be bound to a particular model forever. Flexibility is therefore increased as changing the model can be done at the session or project level without changing the subagent setup.

# Task 3 — Run the Security Auditor

## Goal

Trigger the security auditor agent and analyze the generated security report for your Terraform infrastructure.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — The delegation message showing Claude launched the security-auditor

# Task 4 — Run the Cost Optimizer

## Goal

Trigger the cost optimizer agent and review the generated cost optimization report.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — The full cost optimization report

# Task 5 — Share Your AI Team Achievement on LinkedIn

## Goal

Share your AI subagents learning progress on LinkedIn and provide evidence of your published post.

### LinkedIn Post

Use the LinkedIn post template provided in the assignment guideline.

Make sure your published post includes:

- Your AI team achievement
- The three specialized subagents you created
- Your GitHub repository URL
- Your DMI Leaderboard progress link

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 7 — Published LinkedIn post showing your post content and leaderboard progress link visible
